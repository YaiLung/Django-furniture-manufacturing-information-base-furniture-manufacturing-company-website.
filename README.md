   This code represents the migration of Django, tables for the Product, Client and Order models in the database. Migration includes defining fields for each model, such as title and photo for products, name and email for customers, and quantity and total cost for orders. It also establishes relationships between tables via foreign keys, sets display and sorting parameters, and determines that migration is initial.

The next equally important function for us is the ability to test the site in Open server. Testing the site in Open Server provides developers with the opportunity to test the operation and functionality of their web applications on a local machine before publishing them. With Open Server, developers can emulate the environment of a real server, check the interaction between the client and the server, test the code and functionality of applications, as well as track and fix errors before the site is launched in a real environment. This saves time and resources, as well as ensures higher quality and reliability of the web applications being developed.
