   This code represents the migration of Django, tables for the Product, Client and Order models in the database. Migration includes defining fields for each model, such as title and photo for products, name and email for customers, and quantity and total cost for orders. It also establishes relationships between tables via foreign keys, sets display and sorting parameters, and determines that migration is initial.
